# Project Overview

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis to determine countries' groupings based on COVID-19 level risk through the use of the K-means clustering method. The project will demonstrate the use of proprietary software tools such as IBM SPSS Modeller, JMP Statistical Software and MS Excel to accurately group countries based on their risk level by employing the most effective clustering strategies using two distinct time periods and selecting the most suitable variables. Through the use of the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, the project aims to derive valuable insights by utilising data analytics techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA) and K-means clustering modelling to derive valuable insights country grouping based on their COVID-19 level risk.
